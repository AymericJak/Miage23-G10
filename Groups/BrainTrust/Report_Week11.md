AGOUAZI Lynda  & CHAMI Nour & SAHNOUNE Thilleli


Throughout this week, our collaborative efforts have been evident in our joint work during the last two sessions. 
Here are the key highlights:
- **Game part:** We delved into resolving the challenge of logic interactions between neighbors of neighbors in our game.
After that, the teacher gave us helpful feedback and fixed some problems in our code.
He also organized our code into different parts, like the part you see on the screen (UI) and the part that does the behind-the-scenes work (Model). Notably, during the teacher's guidance, an enhancement suggestion for Enzo's game Takuzu emerged, leading to the initiation of a pull request, which one of our team members promptly executed.
- **Course part**: we learned about  programming interfaces, with illustrative examples in pharo and java.
A significant revelation emerged during discourseâ€”specifically, the relevance of interfaces in statically-typed languages and their perceived lack of utility in dynamically-typed languages.
- **Next Week:** our plan is to create a new method that aims to remove visited elements and replace them with those positioned above.
