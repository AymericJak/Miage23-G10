Design Sketch

SameGame is a tile-matching puzzle game. Its objective is to clear a grid or game board of colored or patterned tiles by removing groups of adjacent tiles of the same color or pattern.

Components:
Game Board :A grid-based game board containing colored game pieces, and a grid-layout to arrange the pieces.
Game Blocks: individual game pieces where each piece has attributes( color, type, position on the game board)
Score Display: An area to display the player's score(it may be a box)
New Game Button: to start a new game.
Game Over Screen

Working method:
-define the basic and important element we should have and how to code them 
-In order to do that we shall start with small scenarios , like a 2x2 board where all blocks have the same color or every two blocks have the same oneâ€¦ .how can we code this ?
