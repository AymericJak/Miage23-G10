For this week, I have:
*Learned about the visitor with the teacher.
*Delved into the sokoban project to understand its implementation logic and the components used.
*Started the implementation of the samegame ( I have fixed the logic to follow for the code with my teammates, and I made some basic components ).

*I wanted to write some tests on what i did but i didn’t have enough time so i made some during the week and i’ll continue the next session.
*The challenging part was implementing the game logic and translating my ideas to smalltalk code using the Myg Template and the blocs.

Takeaways from the week : 
 * I focused on discovering the bloc elements in order to create an interactive interface. 
 * I went through the BlElement, Blspace, the grid layout (for sameGame), the 2d Arrays and how to handle mouse click events. 
 * I tried some different implementations and chose to stick with one that is similar to the games created with the MYG framework.
 * Next week I will continue working on the game with my team and do the exercises provided for the different patterns.
 * and lastly it is quite important to style our project by adding a baseline to make it easy for the other part to load it.
