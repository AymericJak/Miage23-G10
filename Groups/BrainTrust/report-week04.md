Lynda AGOUAZI:

In the fourth session of this module, I acquired knowledge on the double dispatch mechanism and its practical application to eliminate the need for conditional statements. Additionally, I delved into the types: symmetrical (Paper-Scissors-Stone) and asymmetrical (Sokoban game).
During the latter part of the session, I focused on comprehending the AVLTree project. This project revolves around a self-balancing binary search tree data structure known as the AVL tree. Its primary objective is to maintain balance throughout its structure, especially when performing insertions and deletions, ensuring that it retains its equilibrium.
Initially, I encountered some difficulties in understanding the project due to the absence of comprehensive documentation. To overcome this hurdle, I turned to online resources, particularly Google, where I discovered informative videos that aided my understanding.

I proceeded to extract key classes from the project, such as the "AVLTree" class, which encompasses various methods for adding, accessing, and searching for elements within the tree. Additionally, I encountered the "AVLAbstractNode" class, which provides a framework of methods and categories for use by subclasses (AVLNode and AVLNilNode), with the expectation that they would implement behavior specific to AVL nodes. I also recognized the need for more extensive testing, as the project was lacking sufficient test coverage.
I also revisited the Artefact project from where I stopped in the previous session. This time, I gained a clearer understanding of the project's architecture and how the code operates. I successfully generated a PDF document by executing the demo method as outlined in the project guide. Subsequently, I followed the provided guidelines to create a personalized document tailored to my preferences.

Towards the end of the session, I identified certain errors in the code. I embarked on the task of understanding the root causes of these errors and attempted to rectify one of them. However, due to the extensive number of classes and methods, I encountered some challenges in pinpointing the exact causes of these issues.
Nevertheless, I managed to address one of the bugs when I had more time to work on it at home.

takeaways 4th lecture: 
- I learned about double dispatch but didn't do much exercises. I shall do them this week.
- Discover the AVLTree project : i runned mutation tests using Mutalk and get a score of 63 % , the project needed additional tests, i managed to write four ( test fo RL, LR, testing scenarios where there is a duplicate node , and test the method IsTotalBalanced ) , i sent a pull request , added them successfully to the project source code in github.
- I went through Artefact methods, there was a visitor pattern, however, the project had multiple classes , i couldnâ€™t go through them all.
- Overall , I can say there is significant progress between day one and today (a lot of ambiguities are gone).
