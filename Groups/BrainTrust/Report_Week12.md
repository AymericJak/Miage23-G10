Throughout this week, we worked well together as in the last sessions. Here are the main things we did:
- We  tried to implement the method  to replace visited elements with those positioned above
- We made improvements on the game interface
- We tried to resolve the problem we had with the baseline
- We managed to get all the neighbors of the same color using a stack algorithm.
