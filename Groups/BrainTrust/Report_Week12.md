Throughout this week, we worked well together as in the last sessions. Here are the main things we did:
- We  tried to implement the method  to replace visited elements with those positioned above
- We made improvements on the game interface
- We managed to get all the neighbors of the same color using a stack algorithm.
- We attempted to address the issue with the baseline, seeking suggestions in the Pharo Discord channel.
However, we're still in the process of resolving it.
