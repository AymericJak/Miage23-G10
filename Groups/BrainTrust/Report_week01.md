Report: First Lecture on Pharo Programming
What I Did:
-I installed Pharo according to the official tutorial.
-I created a Pharo image and began acquiring a fundamental understanding of the language's syntax with ProfStef.
-I followed the PDF and videos to create a package, a class "MyCounter", methods and a test.
-I created a GitHub repository.

What I Did Not Do:
Initially, I faced difficulty comprehending the concept of "forking" a project. However, with explanations in the lecture and supplementary video tutorials, I later achieved clarity on this topic.

Difficulties Encountered and Solutions: Test Execution and Loading project: 
I encountered problems concerning the execution of tests and loading of components. I resolved these issues by revisiting YouTube tutorials and verifying the steps to ensure correctness of what I did.


CHAMI Nour :

For the first lecture i would like to summarize the key takeaways from the session in 3 points : 
- A/ We learned about PHARO for OOP , We installed it and learned how to create in order ( packages=> classes => methods). we created a very basic example(a counter) and did several tests(increment, decrement).
- B/ I learned about using GIT and GITHUB , I knew them as concept before , however i never used them until now.
- C/ I faced some problems in my first interaction with Pharo and when trying to load my pharo project into my remote repository ( SSH and HTTPS related problems) , however after reading some PDFs i finally managed to upload it successfully.
