Report_Week 05

Lynda AGOUAZI
In this week's session, we presented our work on the two projects "Artefact" and "AVLTree", and we assisted the presentations of our colleagues so that we improve our presentation skills also avoid making the same errors.  
What I learned and I didn't know  before:
        - Incorporate code directly into PowerPoint for improved presentations instead of screenshots.
        - Ensure the last page of a presentation contains important key points and don't end the presentation with an empty page.

We conducted our presentations, in which we had the chance to analyze and understand various viewpoints, as well as to identify and learn from the mistakes made by others.
Subsequently, I began working on our double linked list homework assignment, and so far, progress has been smooth.
