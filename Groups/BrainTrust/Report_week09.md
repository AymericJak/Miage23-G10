For this week We have all worked together the whole session since we worked on the same projetct.
We have 
- Resolved the problem of working on the same project ( we had problems when one of us made a push and the other makes pull or even when loading the project)
- Interface Development: we made significant progress in creating important interfaces with their corresponding components and methods.
- Game Logic: we successfully addressed the identification of neighbors for individual elements. However, extending this logic to encompass neighbors of neighbors posed a challenge,
  prompting a plan for focused improvement in the coming week.
- We wanted to add more tests but we didnâ€™t have enough time so we decided to make them the coming week.
- For the course part, we have learned about the concept of delegation and compared it with the concept of inheritance. We took the example of TextEditor.
