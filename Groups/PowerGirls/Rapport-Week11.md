This week we learned about the static, dynamic types, polymorphism and surcharge. I studied the lectures and concepts that we learned in class.
## Game 
Key achievements : 
-  Implemented collision detection with walls and trails that triggers a game over interface that gives the user two options : Press on S to restart or on Q to quit the game.
-  Introduced a second player enabling two-player gameplay

Challenges : 
- Difficulty on achieving automated player movement.
- On collision with trails, the game over interface shows up and the game is ended but the quit and restart options still has errors
