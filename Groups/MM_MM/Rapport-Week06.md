Last week we had the presentation and I am thinking it went well and I finally had the time to go through the Double Dispatch lesson and exercices, I tried to find more videos on the topic and attempted
the differents approch for the rock, paper, scissors exercice to help me understand better.

We were assigned the tasks to work on building a game in pharo and I went through  the lessons once again briefly, watched some relevent videos of game building ( didn't really find one in pharo tho ) tried to
have a common understanding for the game already provided ( 'Sokoban' since we are kind of working on a similar logic ), I don't know why but this link didn't work 
( https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/ ) was hoping to find more help :(.
