# What did I do ?
In this week we came to learn about the object OOP and its different notions and utilities in Pharo we realized the interest of late binding and its impact on flexibility and polymorphy in OOP and booleen implementation.
I went through a number of the lessons provided for this notion and then watched the videos provided on the youtube chanel and performed the applications along which helped me to really understand.
# What did I learn ?
I came to learn about this two notions : A self send triggers a dynamic method lookup starting in the class of the receiver, A super send triggers a static method lookup starting in the superclass of the class of the method performing the super send which is almost the same case in java(self is a reference to the object instance for which you are currently performing the application, super allows you to access attributes (methods, members, etc) of an ancestor) again I am comparing the two but I gues that just is my way of learning.
