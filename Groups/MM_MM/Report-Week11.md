- For this week we have focused on making significant progress in our project
- We decided to follow the booklet provided about bloc in Memory Game Tutorials so that we are
  able to make our own model and to determine the exact composites needed
 
- First we done the logical part or the back-end using a 'matrice' to test the values generated 
  after every mouvement up, down, left and right
 
- Then we proceeded to do the User-Interface side or front-end using a similar logic to both Takuzu and MineSweeper 
  which gives us a show of the game and generate different grid sizes according to choosen levels
 
- Now we have both company performing correctly we are working on the right way to combine them which only opened our 
  eyes to many more changes that need to be made
 
- We are still working on combining them, but we can say we started solving the puzzle and making certain changes 
  to hopefully reach our goal
