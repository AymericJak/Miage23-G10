 This week was for the presentations on AVL Tree and Artifact
 * I was the one doing the AVL Tree presentation
 * I get to show my work in front of my professors and collegues and get feedback regarding what I did, where I lacked and what I could have did better
 * I listened to the presentation to my collegues comparing their work and feedback to mine
 * Worked on the DoubleLinkedList, still in process
 * Learned more about the mutation testing how I should try to better the score by fixing the test but not really sure how to do that yet, what changes? and how?
