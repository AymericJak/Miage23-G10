# Week 10 Work Report

### Harrar M'hamed

Week 10 was pivotal in our Bomberman project, with significant advancements in both testing and game logic, paralleled by our learning about advanced OOP concepts.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Application**:
  - Continued to implement TDD practices, which helped in progressing systematically through the project. I focused on enhancing existing tests for greater efficiency, such as ensuring player movements were accurately reflected in the game state.

- **Game Logic and Interface Development**:
  - Dedicated time to refining the game logic, specifically improving how the game handles player interactions and environmental elements. Although I faced time constraints, there are plans to further develop the visual aspects of the game in the upcoming week.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Complexity in Game Mechanics**:
  - The challenge of implementing advanced game mechanics, particularly in handling complex relationships like neighbors of neighbors, was more intricate than initially anticipated. This required a deeper understanding and creative problem-solving approaches.

- **Balancing Development with Testing**:
  - Balancing the development of new features with adequate testing continued to be a challenge. Ensuring that new features are well-tested before integration is crucial for maintaining code quality and game functionality.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Game Development Project**:
  - Continue to refine and expand the game logic, placing a stronger emphasis on enhancing the visual interface and user experience.
  - Increase focus on testing, particularly graphical testing, to ensure the stability and robustness of the game as more features are added.

#### Course Learnings:

- **Advanced OOP Concepts**:
  - Deepened understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, particularly Subclassing and Subtyping. The distinction between these concepts in Java and Pharo was enlightening and provided valuable insights.
