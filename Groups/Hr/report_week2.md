# Report week 2


### Harrar M'hamed

For the second week, I mainly chose to strengthen my grasp on Pharo by studying Smalltalk, its predecessor, and learning more about it. I also started exploring the AVL project, which I'll be making an analysis presentation on for the 5th week.

#### Completed Tasks :

    - Followed interactive hands-on courses on Smalltalk at [https://amber-lang.net/learn.html] and [https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/smalltalk/].

    - I found this conversation particularly interesting [https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2lw1fk/if_smalltalk_is_so_good_why_does_nobody_use_it/]. It helped me gain insights into the perspectives of the developer community regarding Smalltalk's adoption and relevance in the modern software landscape. Its early adoption was also influenced by market dynamics as it  it had a monolithic structure and was expensive relative to other languages at the time, which didnt allow it to get enough traction to take off.

    - Reviewed various concepts related to polymorphism, such as early and late binding, Parse Time vs. Runtime, as well as storage on stacks and heaps and their use cases.

    - Delved into the keywords "super" and "this", understanding what they refer to in different situations and how they point in memory.


#### Encountered Challenges  :

    - Insufficient online resources to view Pharo concepts from different perspectives. When something doesn't "click" for me right away, I usually consult multiple resources explaining the same concept to see different approaches of viewing it. Fortunately, I haven't yet come across concepts that are particularly challenging to understand, but this concerns me moving forward.

    - Initially, I faced challenges in gaining a confident understanding of low-level memory management, especially regarding allocation and deallocation in stack and heap structures. However, after goign through graphical representations and diagrams of said concepts, I was able to grasp these processes better. I am someone who primarily learns visually, relying on diagrams and graphics to assimilate concepts.


#### Remaining Tasks :

    - Starting work on the presentation for week 5 regarding the AVL project.
