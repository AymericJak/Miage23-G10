# Week 9 Work Report

### Harrar M'hamed

Week 9 marked a significant collaborative effort in our ongoing Bomberman project, aligning with the class focus on design patterns and project management.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Collaborative Project Management**:
  - Addressed and resolved issues related to collaborative work on our project. We improved the teams understanding and handling of version control, particularly in managing concurrent updates and pull requests, and established good practices and work flows,enhancing our team's efficiency. 

- **Interface Development**:
  - Made substantial progress in developing key interfaces for our Bomberman game. This involved creating essential components and methods, ensuring a robust and user-friendly interface, the visual aspect is still missing.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Advanced Game Mechanics**:
  - The complexity of developing an extended logic for neighbors in the game proved to be more challenging than anticipated. This requires a deeper dive into algorithmic solutions and may involve experimenting with different approaches.

- **Time Management for Testing**:
  - Balancing time between developing new features and writing tests was a challenge. Although we intended to add more tests, time constraints led us to postpone this task. Ensuring adequate testing will be a priority in the coming week.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Game Development Project**:
  - Continue developing the Bomberman game, with a focus on improving the neighbor identification algorithm and implementing more complex game scenarios.
  - Prioritize writing tests for the newly developed features to ensure code reliability and functionality.
  - Explore advanced interface elements and visual enhancements, drawing inspiration from the Sokoban game.

#### Course Learnings:

- **Delegation and Inheritance**:
  - Delved into the concepts of delegation and inheritance. Analyzed their applications and differences, using the TextEditor example to contextualize our understanding.
