# Week 6 Work Report

### Harrar M'hamed

This week, I finalized the selection of the game for the game development project, focusing on a game that offers substantial design potential. This includes the opportunity to implement various design patterns and architectural paradigms. Concurrently, I started reviewing for the upcoming exam.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Mutation Testing**: 
  -   - Got a better understanding of the mechanism overall, different ways that the score can be improved, picking a good mutant on so on...
  
- **Game Development Project**: 
  - Selected a game that i'll be working on and completed an initial version of the UML diagram, which will be iteratively refined throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Distinguishing Between Late Binding and Dynamic Dispatch**: 
  - Initially, I conflated the terms "late binding" and "dynamic dispatch," often using them interchangeably. However, I have since learned that one is a mechanism that facilitates the other

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Game Development Project**: 
  - Continue working on the project.
