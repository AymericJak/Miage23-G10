# Week 5 Report

### Harrar M'hamed

After presenting the analysis of the AVL and Artefact projects, I received valuable feedback that guided my focus for the week. With no lecture scheduled, I took the opportunity to delve deeper into mutation testing and doing the practice of implementing a doubly-linked list in Pharo, followed by its mutation testing.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Mutation Testing**: 
  - Redid the exercice on mutation testing after going through the related slides again.
  - Analyzed the mutation score, which is the ratio of killed mutants to total mutants, to understand the effectiveness of the existing test cases.

- **Double-Linked List in Pharo**: 
  - Implemented a double-linked list data structure.
  - thought out the initial design to avoid redundancy
  - Designed methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal and genral operations.
  - Conducted mutation testing on the doubly-linked list to assess the robustness of the tests, focusing on edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Understanding Mutation Scores**: 
  - Initially had difficulty interpreting the mutation scores, specifically how to prioritize which mutants need to be "killed" to improve the score.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Improving Mutation Test Score**: 
  - Plan to revisit the test suite for both the AVL and Artefact projects and the doubly-linked list.
  - Intend to add more comprehensive test cases targeting the mutants that survived the initial round of testing.
