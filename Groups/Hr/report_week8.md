# Week 8 Work Report

### Harrar M'hamed

In week 8, we continued our exploration into game development and design patterns, with a particular focus on advancing our Bomberman project.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Visitor Design Pattern Review**:
  - This week, I revisited the visitor design pattern to further solidify my understanding. I focused on practical applications and nuances in various scenarios, which helped me appreciate its versatility and applicability in different contexts, refactorGuru's website served as a valuable asset to facilitate my understanding with concrete examples.

- **Bomberman Game Development**:
  - Building on our understanding of Sokoban's source code, we began laying the groundwork for our Bomberman project. We designed the basic structure and started implementing foundational elements of the game. 
  - We also initiated discussions on game level design and brainstormed various ideas to make our version of Bomberman unique and engaging.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Design Pattern Integration**:
  - Integrating the visitor design pattern into our game development posed a challenge. I spent some time figuring out how best to apply this pattern to enhance our game's architecture without overcomplicating the design.

- **Game Logic and Mechanics**:
  - Another challenge was in the conceptualization and implementation of game mechanics. Balancing simplicity with engaging gameplay required thoughtful planning and experimentation with different ideas.

- **Visual aspect of the game dev**:
  - The use of myg and bloc seems particularly challenging as there's very little documentation or learning examples online. We figured the best approach is to learn by doing and analyzing existing code in different game project examples.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Game Development Project**:
  - Plan to delve deeper into learning how to use bloc for the UI of our game
