# Week 4 Report

### Harrar M'hamed

During the fourth week, I continued to refine the presentation for week 5, shifting focus from class hierarchies to method implementations and unit testing. I also gained a clearer understanding of the double dispatch design pattern, particularly its application in resolving method calls at runtime.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Week 5 Presentation**: 
  - Outlined class structure and method signatures.
  - Incorporated UML diagrams for architectural representation.

- **Double Dispatch in Rock-Paper-Scissors**: 
  - Implemented the game using double dispatch.
  - Gained insights into dynamic method resolution based on runtime types.

- **Mutation Testing Exercise**: 
  - Conducted mutation testing to assess test suite quality.
  - Gained practical experience in identifying "mutants" and their detection rate.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Code Comprehension**: 
  - Challenges in understanding the AVL and Artefact project codebases. Just a learning curve, nothing blocking.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Week 5 Presentation**: 
  - Finalize slides, focusing on code snippets and diagrams to visualize structures.
