# Week 7 Work Report

### Harrar M'hamed

For week 7, we had a lecture about the visitor design pattern which is used to separate an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. 

Then I joined a new group for the project, we agreed on developing a version of Bomberman.

#### Completed Tasks:

- **Visitor Design Pattern**:
  - Gained a better understanding of the mechanism overall, how the two domains interact and why we need them. The key takeaway was recognizing that the visitor pattern enables operations to be defined and added to classes without changing the classes themselves. This is especially beneficial in situations where classes are closed for modification, but new functionality is required.

- **Game Development Project**:
  - We started off by analyzing the source code of Sokoban as it has a similar structure to ours when it came to the game floor and movement mechanics. We took insights from its approach to movement and level design. Additionally, we will start off with writing some unit tests to get started with development, focusing on the initial game setup and basic player movements.

#### Encountered Challenges:

- **Visitor Effectiveness and Usefulness**:
  - Initially, I didn't really see the point of using the visitor pattern where other design patterns could achieve similar outcomes with less complexity. However, it clicked when I realized its strength in extending functionality of complex class hierarchies. Particularly, I appreciated its ability to perform operations across a set of differently typed elements without needing to query their types.

#### Remaining Tasks:

- **Game Development Project**:
  - Continue working on the project by further developing the game mechanics.
