## Exercices
I try to finish the exercices about flags, there are here : https://github.com/maureencfr/C3P/tree/main/src/Flags

I still have errors about the method *importCountriesFrom*, that's a SubscriptOutOfBoundsException, I haven't fix this error yet.

## Practice message dispatch

I write a little class here : https://github.com/maureencfr/C3P/tree/main/src/dispatch
With the testcases I check if the behaviour I expected was the behaviour make by the program. If two arguments are integer it must do the addition, if two arguments are string it must be a concatenation with a space between and for all other combinations it must return the message 'Cas non pris en charge'.
My tests are green so the behaviour I expected is the behaviour the program have.
But I also read that we could avoid conditionals because a message send can be seen as a conditionnal without explicit if, and I'm not sure to know how to implements message disptach without it so maybe I missed a point

## Prepare

I read the slides about reverse engineering and LRU cache. I don't have many questions because the theory seems to be clear but I think I need to practice it to be sure that I fully understand the subject.
