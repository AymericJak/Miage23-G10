Nadia ::
This week's activities revolved around presentations and practical learning experiences. 
After presenting our analysis of the AVL and Artefact projects, we received valuable feedback, also the presentations done by various groups in the class provided insights into different approaches to the two projects. 
I engaged later on in implementing a doubly-linked list in Pharo to gain a better understanding of class implementation.
