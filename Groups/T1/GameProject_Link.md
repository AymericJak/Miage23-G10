### TakToe Game

Players represent either Orange or Black as their chosen colors. The objective is to strategically place their color token in an empty cell during each turn, aiming to align three of their colors either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The game concludes with the declaration of the winner, the master of color alignment. If the board is full and there's no winner, the game ends in a draw.
