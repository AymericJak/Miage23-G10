Nadia ::
In this week s class, I learned about double dispatch and its importance in simplifying conditional statements, especially in the context of the Visitor design pattern.

I continued analyzing the AVL and Artefact project, trying to understand there structure and key components. I also started preparing presentation slides.

In terms of practical application, I explored double dispatch and intend to practice it more in the next week.
