During the course sessions, I explored the Composite Pattern by examining a tree structure that contained directories and files as an illustrative example.
I understood how this pattern works, enabling the polymorphic treatment of both simple and composite elements.
Concerning the game project, we noticed that the logic in the Takuzu and MineSweeper games closely aligns with our project's requirements. This observation provided valuable insights that could potentially enhance our project's development.
