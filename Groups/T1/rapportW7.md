This week, and before the exam, i focused extensively on preparing for my exam in an organized manner. I dedicated time to in-depth study of my course materials and worked on practical exercises. I practiced with tricky problems and quizzes related to my subjects and that helped me learn and feel a bit more confident for the upcoming exam.
