Group 13: Week 2 report  

SOLEIMANI 	SEPIDEH

Dispatch is the mechanism which determines what method must be run when a message is sent to an object. 

Inorder to understand better I wrote a program with a class and subclasses which determines the department of students. All subclasses have the same methods ‘Name’ and ‘Get:’. Which will be called properly based on the defined subclass.
I also left a subclass without method ‘Name’, in this case when method name is called, the ‘Name’ of the main class will be executed to clarify that the student's department is not confirmed yet.
Without dispatch in Pharo, we would have been forced to compare the defined object in the structure of the class to see which method should be run.
