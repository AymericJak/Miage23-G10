# Enter Chess

This year's practice will revolve around a chess game implementation available in https://github.com/UnivLille-Meta/Chess/
The repository contains the code, dependencies and a list of **katas**.

Chess rules can be find online.
Check for example the videos and explanations in chess.com (https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess) or wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess).
Do not hesitate to look online for other resources.

Note that you don't need to be a chess grand master, or to know how to play to implement a chess game :).

## Your tasks

In groups, you have to choose different katas to solve.
Katas are tagged with **Goals**, specifying what you are going to practice/learn with that kata.

- Each group has to solve one kata per person. You are free to organize as you want. For example, you can divide each kata in subtasks, and treat all katas simultaneously, or treat katas one by one.
- You need to choose *at least* one refactoring kata per group.

## Your deliverables

At the end of the semester, you need to deliver:

 - the git repository with the katas
 - a markdown report inside the repository explaining
   - what katas you did
   - what design decisions you took (how you did it and why that way)
   - what difficulties you encountered and how you solved them
   - how well is your code tested and how did you do it. Automated testing, mutation testing, manual testing?
